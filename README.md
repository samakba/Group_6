## Project Summary

### What This Project Does
The Event Heatmap Visualization Application is a desktop software that allows users to visualize event data through interactive heatmaps on geographical maps. Users can authenticate into the system, view event intensity across different locations, and filter data based on various criteria.

### Why This Project Was Made
This project was developed to address the need for intuitive visualization of geographical event data. Traditional data tables and charts make it difficult to understand spatial patterns in event distribution and intensity. Our application solves this by providing:
- **Visual clarity**: Immediate understanding of event concentration areas
- **Interactive exploration**: Real-time filtering and navigation capabilities
- **User-friendly interface**: Accessible to both technical and non-technical users

### Problem This Project Solves
The application is ideal for users who need to:
- Analyze event distribution patterns across geographical areas
- Identify hotspots and areas of low activity
- Filter event data based on intensity thresholds
- Present geographical data in an accessible, visual format

## Features

### **User Authentication System**
- **Sign Up**: Create new user accounts with username/password
- **Login**: Secure access with credential validation
- **Logout**: Safe session termination
- **Password Management**: Change password functionality

*Secure login interface with input validation*

### **Interactive Heatmap Visualization**
- **Real-time Data Display**: Dynamic loading of event data points
- **Color-coded Intensity**: Blue (low) to Red (high intensity) gradient
- **Pan and Zoom**: Full map navigation capabilities
- **OpenStreetMap Integration**: High-quality base maps

### **Advanced Filtering Options**
- **Weight Thresholds**: Filter events by minimum intensity (0.2 to 0.9)
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant filter application
- **Reset Functionality**: Return to original data view
